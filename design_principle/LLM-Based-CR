If you'd like, I can help you build out a prototype for one of the components (e.g., a GitHub bot, a CLI tool, or prompt templates). Let me know which part you're most interested in developing first!





You said:
For now, we are focus on python programming language, and want to integrate it into git system, can you help with more design details? 


ChatGPT said:
Updated saved memory
Great! Focusing on Python and integrating into the Git system gives you a clear, manageable scope. Here's a more detailed project breakdown tailored to that focus:

üõ†Ô∏è Project Scope
Objective: Build a Python code review tool powered by an LLM, integrated directly into Git workflows (e.g., via pre-commit hooks, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI).

üìÅ System Components
1. Trigger Layer
Where and how the review is triggered:

Option	Description
Pre-commit Hook	Checks staged code before it's committed. Fast, local, but needs setup.
GitHub Action	Runs on every pull request; posts review comments. Scalable and centralized.
CLI tool	Developer runs it manually: llm-review my_script.py

2. File Selection Logic
Only Python files: *.py

Only changed files:

bash
Copy
Edit
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=AM HEAD | grep '\.py$'
3. Code Chunking
Extract functions and classes using AST:

python
Copy
Edit
import ast

def extract_functions(code):
    tree = ast.parse(code)
    return [node for node in ast.walk(tree) if isinstance(node, ast.FunctionDef)]
Optionally, split long functions or modules for LLM input size limits (e.g., 4K tokens).

4. Prompt Design (Python-Specific)
Customize for Pythonic issues, PEP8, bugs, best practices.

Prompt Example:

text
Copy
Edit
You are a Python expert. Review this function for bugs, anti-patterns, and suggest improvements. Follow PEP8, comment clearly.

```python
def my_function(x,y):
  return x+y
yaml
Copy
Edit

---

### 5. **LLM Backend**
Options:
- OpenAI (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo)
- Local models (e.g., Code Llama, StarCoder)

API interface:
```python
def query_llm(prompt: str) -> str:
    # Call to OpenAI or local model
    ...
6. Result Formatting
Markdown for GitHub comments

Summary table of issues:

markdown
Copy
Edit
| Line | Issue Type | Description | Suggested Fix |
|------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| 23   | Style      | Missing space after comma | `x, y` |
7. GitHub Integration
Use GitHub Actions:

llm-review.yml (workflow):

yaml
Copy
Edit
name: LLM Code Review

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**/*.py'

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run LLM Code Review
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          python review.py
8. Commenting Back
Use GitHub API to leave review comments programmatically:

python
Copy
Edit
from github import Github

g = Github(GITHUB_TOKEN)
repo = g.get_repo("owner/repo")
pr = repo.get_pull(PR_NUMBER)
pr.create_review_comment(body="...", commit_id=..., path=..., position=...)
‚öôÔ∏è Optional Features
Lint-aware fallback (combine with flake8, black, or pylint)

Config file for team rules: .llmreviewrc

‚ÄúFix it‚Äù button that applies LLM-suggested edits

üìå Development Milestones
Phase	Feature Set
MVP	CLI tool + pre-commit hook + basic prompt
V1	GitHub Action + AST-aware chunking + LLM API
V2	GitHub comments + config + auto-fix

Would you like me to generate a starter repo structure, example Python code for GitHub integration, or prompt tuning templates next?

‚úÖ Your LLM-based Python code review tool for pre-commit hooks is now implemented.

üóÇÔ∏è Key Features Included:
AST-based function chunking

OpenAI GPT-4 integration

Git-staged .py file detection

Terminal-friendly output

Blocks commit if review detects issues

Logs everything in logs/review.log

‚úÖ Next Steps for Integration:
Set up .pre-commit-hooks.yaml in your repo:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- id: llm-review
  name: LLM Code Review
  entry: python llm_review.py
  language: system
  types: [python]
Configure .pre-commit-config.yaml:

yaml
Copy
Edit
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: llm-review
Install the pre-commit hook:

bash
Copy
Edit
pre-commit install
Would you like me to add the YAML files and CLI documentation next?





You said:
Thanks for that, please give me instructions how to config pre-commit hooks? 


ChatGPT said:
You're welcome! Here's a step-by-step guide to configure and use your LLM-based Python code review with the pre-commit framework:

‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Configure pre-commit Hooks for LLM Review
1. Install pre-commit (if not already installed)
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pre-commit
2. Create .pre-commit-hooks.yaml (in your repo)
This file defines your custom hook:

yaml
Copy
Edit
# .pre-commit-hooks.yaml
- id: llm-review
  name: LLM Code Review
  entry: python llm_review.py
  language: system
  types: [python]
3. Create .pre-commit-config.yaml (also in root of your repo)
This file tells pre-commit to use your local hook:

yaml
Copy
Edit
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: llm-review
4. Install the hook locally
Once both files are set, install the hook into your Git environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
pre-commit install
You should now see:

sql
Copy
Edit
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
5. Test it out!
Make a change to a .py file and try to commit:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add your_script.py
git commit -m "Try commit"
If issues are found, the hook will print LLM feedback and block the commit.

üõ†Ô∏è Optional: Manual Run
If you want to run the hook manually, use:

bash
Copy
Edit
pre-commit run --all-files
Or just run the script directly:

bash
Copy
Edit
python llm_review.py
üß™ Developer Workflow Summary
Action	Command
Install pre-commit	pip install pre-commit
Install hook	pre-commit install
Test hook	pre-commit run
Add file & commit	git add file.py && git commit -m \"msg\"

Would you like me to bundle all of this into a GitHub-ready starter repo zip or provide sample Python files for testing?
